Moreover, most protein-coding genes in mammals are fragmented, with only a small fraction of the primary RNA transcript being spliced together to form messenger RNA. For many years it was assumed that untranslated RNA molecules served no useful purpose but, starting in the mid-1990s, a small body of researchers, including the present author (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib14\">Mattick, 1994</xref>), have been arguing that these RNAs transmit regulatory information, possibly associated with the emergence of multicellular organisms. This is supported by the observation that the proportion of noncoding genomic sequences broadly correlates with developmental complexity, reaching over 98% in mammals (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib12\">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), although others have argued that the increase in genome size is due to the inefficiency of selection against non-functional elements as body size goes up and population size goes down (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib13\">Lynch, 2007</xref>)."

Moreover, the repertoire of these lncRNAs is different in different cells (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib3\">Carninci et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib4\">Cheng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib2\">Birney et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib17\">Mercer et al., 2012</xref>).

However, assessments of sequence conservation rely on assumptions about the non-functionality and representative distribution of reference sequences, which are not verified and cannot be directly tested (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib20\">Pheasant and Mattick, 2007</xref>). Nonetheless, many lncRNAs show patches of relative sequence conservation (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib5\">Derrien et al., 2012</xref>), and even more do so at the secondary structural level (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib23\">Smith et al., 2013</xref>)."

The precision of lncRNA expression is consistent with evidence suggesting that many are associated with chromatin-modifying complexes, thereby acting as regulators of the epigenetic control of differentiation and development (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib18\">Mercer and Mattick, 2013</xref>)."

However, these results seem at odds with the fact that few lncRNAs have been identified in traditional genetic screens. The reason for this is likely a combination of phenotypic, technical and expectational bias: mutations in protein-coding regions of the genome generally have phenotypes that are more severe, and are easier to identify, than those in non-coding regions. By contrast, in this context, it is worth noting that \u223c95% of all variants associated with complex (as opposed to monogenic) diseases in humans map to non-coding, presumably regulatory, sequences (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib7\">Freedman et al., 2011</xref>)."

The phenotypes of two of the mutants were analyzed in detail: one of the mutants that died showed defects in multiple organs (including the lung, heart and gastrointestinal tract), and one of the mutants that survived with growth defects also showed defects in the cerebral cortex. Other mutants that did not exhibit overt developmental defects showed brain-specific expression patterns and may be associated with cognitive defects that are not grossly apparent at the developmental level."

A good example is a noncoding RNA called BC1 that is widely expressed in the brain: knockout of BC1 causes no visible anatomical consequences, but it leads to a behavioural phenotype that would be lethal in the wild (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib10\">Lewejohann et al., 2004</xref>)."
