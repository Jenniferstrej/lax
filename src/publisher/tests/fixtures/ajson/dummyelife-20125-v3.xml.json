The data are of very high quality, the manuscript clearly written, and the conclusions convincingly supported by the data. The investigators performed whole exome sequencing (WES) of 132 parent-offspring trios and 59 additional probands. Seven percent of probands had damaging de novo or rare transmitted mutations in SMAD6; an inhibitor of BMP \u2013 induced osteoblast differentiation (P <10-20). Interestingly, SMAD6 mutations showed striking incomplete penetrance for the craniosynostosis trait (<60%). Genotypes of a common variant near BMP2, previously shown to be strongly associated with midline craniosynostosis, explained nearly all of the phenotypic variance in these kindred. Thus, these findings clearly documented digenic inheritance via epistatic interactions of rare and common variants as a defining feature of the most frequent cause of midline craniosynostosis.

We speculated in the manuscript that other common variants, particularly those with relatively large effects, may show similar epistatic interactions with rare variants. The common BBS9 risk variant, which clearly falls into this class, would be an excellent candidate for modifying risk of rare variants in another gene or genes.", "type": "paragraph"}, {"text": "<italic>4) Though most of the identified SMAD6 mutations would generate clear loss-of-function, two of them are located near the C-terminus (i.e. R465C and I490T).

It is possible that these variants impair SMAD6 binding to these signaling molecules, impairing inhibition of BMP/SMAD signaling.", "type": "paragraph"}, {"text": "<italic>5) SMAD7 is another inhibitory Smad that affects both BMP and TGF-beta pathways. Although a craniofacial phenotype is not appreciated in Smad7 mutant mice, they show similar skeletal phenotypes to Smad6 knockouts. One would think mutations in SMAD7 might also interact with the BMP2 risk allele. Does the lack of SMAD7 mutations in their patient cohort, suggest a particularly unique role for SMAD6 in midline craniosynostosis?</italic> ", "type": "paragraph"}, {"text": "Yes, the data would support this inference. It has been suggested that <italic>SMAD6</italic> is more specific to regulation of BMP signaling, whereas <italic>SMAD7</italic> is more specific for inhibition of TGFB-receptor - mediated SMAD signaling. Mutations in TGFBR1/2, and its downstream inhibitor SKI, have been shown to cause syndromic forms of craniosynostosis that also involve the cardiovascular system and are markedly more severe than the non-syndromic craniosynostosis phenotype resulting from SMAD6/BMP2 variants. It is thus possible that heterozygous loss of function mutations in <italic>SMAD7</italic> have a more extreme, potentially early lethal, phenotype than <italic>SMAD6</italic> mutations, accounting for why we have not seen these mutations in our cohort. Consistent with this possibility, zero heterozygous loss of function variants in <italic>SMAD7</italic> have been reported in the ExAC database.", "type": "paragraph"}, {"text": "<italic>6) Line 315: \"The only other clinical finding found[\u2026]\" could be reworded as \"finding present\" or \"observed\u201d.</italic>", "type": "paragraph"}, {"text": "We agree, thanks.
