A mutation at the phosphorylation priming site of PER2 attenuates sequential phosphorylation and consequently destabilizes PER2 proteins. The mouse model expressing mutant PER2 exhibits a shortened circadian period accompanied with large phase-advance in sleep-wake rhythms (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib46\">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). This sequential phosphorylation region of PER2 was later found to be modulated by another post-translational regulation, <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation, demonstrating an interplay and competition between phosphorylation and <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation of serine residues in this region (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib15\">Kaasik et al., 2013</xref>). These studies highlighted the important role of post-translational regulation of clock proteins\u00a0in vivo\u00a0in humans and also revealed mechanistic insight into the regulation of PER2. Thus, human genetic studies have provided valuable and unique opportunities to elucidate novel molecular mechanisms of circadian/sleep regulation."

Generation of a mouse model carrying the mutation revealed that the mutation causes a FASP-like phenotype in mice with altered circadian period and photic entrainment. We found that the mutation in the CRY2 FAD-binding-domain enhances its affinity for FBXL3, thus destabilizing CRY2 via increased ubiquitylation and targeting for degradation by the proteasome. We conclude that regulation of CRY2 stability by a proper balance of FAD and FBXL3 is essential for the sleep-wake cycle in humans."

                                "text": "We next analyzed voluntary wheel-running activity to evaluate phase-shift and free-running period of the circadian clock for the Tg mouse models. Similar to locomotor activity measured by video tracking (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2A</xref>), wheel-running activity offset times were advanced in h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> vs. h<italic>CRY2-WT</italic> in LD on both m<italic>Cry2</italic> WT and null backgrounds (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s2\">Figure\u00a02\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 2</xref>), while there are no significant differences in activity onset time and acrophase. Interestingly, h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> showed reduced phase-delay when mice were subjected to a 30-min light pulse at ZT14 (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2D,E</xref>), whereas phase-advance was normal in response to a light pulse at ZT22 (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 3</xref>). Thus, mutant mice have reduced sensitivity to entrainment by light at early night compared to control mice. The mice were subsequently released into constant darkness (DD) to determine circadian period. The free-running period of h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> (23.52\u00b10.04\u2009hr) was significantly shorter than that of h<italic>CRY2-WT</italic> (23.70\u00b10.03\u2009hr) and <italic>WT</italic> mice (23.74\u00b10.02\u2009hr) (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2F</xref>). The period shortening phenotype was further enhanced by crossing Tg mice onto the m<italic>Cry2</italic> null background (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 4A</xref>). The shorter circadian period and reduced phase-delay were also observed in another mutant line (23.51\u00b10.06\u2009hr) with a higher mutant transgene copy number (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2s4\">4B</xref>), thus excluding the possibility that the phenotype was due to positional effects of the transgene insertion site in the genome. Of note, there is no significant difference in the periods and phase-shifting of h<italic>CRY2-WT</italic> transgenic vs. transgene negative mice (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig2\">Figure 2E,F</xref>), indicating that the shortening of circadian period and abnormal phase-delay are not simply due to overexpression of h<italic>CRY2</italic>. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the phase-advances in mice and humans results from the <italic>CRY2</italic> mutation. Data from the transgenic mice suggests that the phase advance may be due to a combination of shortened period and altered sensitivity to photic entrainment."

Mutations at amino acid residues critical for FAD binding affect CRY2 repressor activity of E-box-mediated transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib3\">Czarna et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib12\">Hitomi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib33\">Sanada et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, Ser265 of mouse CRY2 (homologous residue of Ser266 in human CRY2) is a phosphorylation site, and the S265D mutation, mimicking a phosphorylated serine 265, reduces CRY2 repressor activity (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib33\">Sanada et al., 2004</xref>). Using a Luciferase assay, we found that the A260T mutation weakened CRY2 repressor activity on <italic>Per1</italic> E-box-mediated transcriptional activation by CLOCK-BMAL1 (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4A</xref>). However, the nuclear CRY2 protein levels in culture cells were decreased by the mutation (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4B</xref>), which could potentially account for the reduction of CRY2 repressor activity (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4A</xref>). We then examined the degradation of CRY2 proteins by cycloheximide (CHX) chase experiments. Consistent with the cellular distribution of CRY2 (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4B</xref>), CRY2-A260T was less stable than CRY2-WT in HEK293 cells, especially in the nucleus (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4C</xref>). Destabilization of CRY2 by the mutation was further verified in a CRY2-LUC based bioluminescence degradation assay, where the protein decay rate can be determined by recording CRY2-LUC bioluminescence in culture (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib10\">Hirano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib11\">Hirota et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 1A</xref>). Although Ala260 does not directly bind to FAD (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib12\">Hitomi et al., 2009</xref>), amino acid conversion from the hydrophobic and small amino acid, alanine, to threonine could alter the conformation of the phosphate loop. This idea is supported by an observation that a mutation from alanine to aspartic acid (A260D) caused a more severe effect on CRY2 repressor activity and protein stability than the A260T mutation (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 1A,B</xref>). We found that human CRY1 harboring the corresponding mutation at position 241 is less stable than CRY1-WT, suggesting a common regulatory mechanism for CRY1 and CRY2 by FAD binding (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 1C</xref>). These results indicate that the conformation of the phosphate loop may play critical roles in regulating CRY2 stability and repressor activity."

We found that treatment of HEK293 cells with FAD increased CRY2-WT protein levels much more than CRY2-A260T (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that stabilization of CRY2 by FAD was reduced by the mutation. This result supports the hypothesis that the A260T mutation alters the FBXL3-CRY2 interaction. We thus carried out a competitive assay by adding FAD to complexed CRY2-FBXL3 to examine the effect of the mutation on the release of CRY2 from purified CRY2-FBXL3 complexes in vitro. Free CRY2-WT protein levels increased with addition of FAD in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, mutant CRY2 was released less readily than CRY2-WT from the complexes even though both forms of CRY2 were bound to FBXL3 at the same level (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">Figure 5C</xref>). In addition, we tested FBXL3-mediated CRY2 degradation using KL001, a small synthetic molecule known to stabilize CRY1 and CRY2 (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib11\">Hirota et al., 2012</xref>) due to its structural similarity to FAD (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib23\">Nangle et al., 2013</xref>). KL001 stabilizes CRY2-WT in a dose-dependent manner as was previously reported (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib11\">Hirota et al., 2012</xref>). However, KL001 failed to stabilize CRY2-A260T to the same extent it did for CRY2-WT (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 1A</xref>). These results indicate that the A260T mutation weakened the function of FAD and KL001 as inhibitors of FBXL3-mediated degradation of CRY2 and that CRY2-A260T is less stable than CRY-WT, likely due to strengthened interaction with FBXL3. To determine whether the A260T mutation indeed modifies the interaction of CRY2 and FBXL3, we performed co-immunoprecipitation analysis. As expected, CRY2-A260T binds more strongly to FBXL3 than CRY2-WT in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">Figure 5E</xref>), consequently leading to more ubiquitylation of the mutant protein (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">Figure 5F</xref>). The effect of the mutation on the binding affinity under in vivo conditions will need to be further evaluated when better human CRY2 antibodies (for immunoprecipitation) become available."

For modeling, we used the mouse CRY2 structure as the crystal structure of mouse CRY2-FBXL3 complex is available (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib44\">Xing et al., 2013</xref>) and amino acid sequence in the phosphate loop perfectly conserved (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig1\">Figure 1B</xref>). The published CRY2-FBXL3 structure (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib44\">Xing et al., 2013</xref>) revealed that space between Ala260 (corresponding to A259T in mouse) and Asp442 (mouse Asp441) in FBXL3-binding form (red) is more opened vs. the FAD-binding form (orange, <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5s1\">Figure\u00a05\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 1B</xref>). The amino acid change from Ala260 to Thr increases molecular density in this space and may alter electrostatic interactions between Ala260Thr and Asp442. As a result, the mutation likely renders the CRY2-A260T more accessible to FBXL3 binding (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 1C</xref>). This model is consistent with the results from CRY2-A260D mutation (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, we demonstrated that the A260T mutation in the FAD binding pocket endows mutant CRY2 with a higher accessibility and affinity for FBXL3, therefore leading to faster proteasomal degradation of mutant vs. wild-type CRY2."

Total protein levels of endogenous CRY2 were significantly lower in synchronized cells derived from h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> vs. h<italic>CRY2-WT</italic> mice at two different time points (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Figure 6A</xref>), even though <italic>Cry2</italic> transcript levels in h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> mice was higher than in h<italic>CRY2-WT</italic> mice (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Figure 6B</xref>).

CRY1 protein levels were also decreased by the mutation in nuclear extracts from liver (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Figure 6C,D</xref>), suggesting that CRY1 is destabilized in h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> mice. At the same time, we found that nuclear expression of PER1 and PER2 were up-regulated in liver extracts from mutant mice, particularly at ZT14 (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Figure 6C,D</xref>), suggesting that the timing of nuclear accumulation of PER proteins is advanced in h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> mice. Although PER1 and PER2 protein levels were significantly altered, their mRNA levels were not different (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig6\">Figure 6E</xref>). A similar alteration of PER1 and PER2 protein levels in the absence of noticeable changes in mRNA levels was previously reported for <italic>Psttm</italic> mutant mouse liver (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib47\">Yoo et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Psttm</italic> mice have a mutation in the <italic>Fbxl21</italic> gene and this mutation decreases the protein level of FBXL21, which functionally competes with FBXL3.

Therefore, he may become progressively more phase advanced as he grows older as a result of the <italic>CRY2</italic> FASP allele as it is unmasked by these developmental changes. It is also possible that the mutation may not have 100% penetrance and therefore the nephew will never manifest the FASP trait."

However, smaller amplitude movements like grooming behavior and moving in the cage were detected by video recording. Wheel running was quite sensitive to detect phase advance of activity offset as this is seen during the dark phase of LD 12:12."

In order to live on a 24\u2009hr day in LD 12:12, wild-type mice need to phase delay a small amount each day because the endogenous circadian period is slightly shorter than 24\u2009hr. A reduced ability to phase-delay observed in the h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> mouse model could contribute to advanced sleep phase, though the mechanism for the altered phase-shift remains to be elucidated.

A mouse model carrying the candidate variant exhibits modest shortening of the circadian period as well as altered phase delay, but not phase advance. At the molecular level, the authors provide evidence for altered protein stability of Cry2 due to the mutation. At the molecular level, the authors demonstrate shorter PER2-driven bioluminescence rhythms in the peripheral oscillators. Importantly, the authors examine the impact of the CRY2 mutation on the normally repressing function of the protein, and demonstrate a possible mechanism through altered interaction with a known binding partner, FBXL3. The results provide insight into the regulation of human sleep timing. However, several of the authors' claims are compromised somewhat by an inconsistent quality in the data. Some revisions are required before a conclusion can be reached on whether all of the authors' claims can be supported."

Interaction of Cry2 with Fbxl3 (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig5\">Figure 5E</xref>) should be confirmed in a physiologically relevant setting (co-immunoprecipitation from transgenic cells/tissues and/or Cry2-deficient cells reconstituted with either Cry2 form, see previous comment)."

One thing that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned from study of familial human behavioral traits is the challenge of recruiting additional family members. Sleep is NOT a disease phenotype, so people are not as motivated to participate with all the questionnaires, interviews, and tests that we would like them to do, especially when they are not getting paid for any of these. In order to overcome this challenge, our approach has been trying our best to recruit as many subjects as possible in each family followed by mutation screening. Proving that a mutation is causal requires demonstration of the behavioral phenotype in a mouse model and the altered molecular functions in vitro/in vivo. If the family has many mutation carriers who have the sleep trait but the mouse model does not demonstrate the phenotype, then we cannot follow up with the mutation even if the number of mutation carriers is higher."

Here, it appears that activity onset around the LD transition is masked by light signal in wheel-running analysis, although we detected advanced activity offset.

Thus, we think that while CRY2-A260T Tg mice wake earlier than WT mice, they are not running on the wheel, likely due to masking to light. In addition, the inconsistency among the analysis tools can be explained by the fact that wheel-running exercise alters mouse behavioral rhythms (Webb et al., Behavioral Neuroscience, 2014) (especially shortens the free-running period). Thus, wheel-running does not reflect the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sleep-wake\u00e2\u20ac\u009d pattern perfectly. We also need to remember that humans do not run on wheels all day long, so wheel-running behavior is likely not the best reflection of human sleep wake behavior. We discussed these points and also the differences in the phenotype of our mice in the Discussion section. Also, we understand so little about the relationship between period length and phase angle of entrainment to speak with too much certainty about what is expected in terms of phase advance for any given endogenous period. We accept that there are differences between mouse and human physiology. The conditions under which we measure such things is also different in mice than in humans (see above). Finally, it is also possible that the phase advance in the humans is due to a combination of effects of period shortening and altered entrainment. We have attempted to enroll these subjects in studies in temporal isolation by our collaborator, Jeanne Duffy. Unfortunately, these subjects did not want to do such an intensive study. We did observed abnormal phase-shifting in the mice, which also is likely to contribute to the phenotype."

The recapitulation of a circadian phenotype led to us to the more detailed molecular analysis showing functional consequences in vitro. Since the reported variant in public databases is rare (0.008% in the ExAc database), and FASP is not uncommon (0.5% in general population, our unpublished data), it is not surprising that this variant exists at a low frequency in the general population (~120,000 in the ExAc database). This variant, therefore, explains a small but measurable proportion of FASP in the population. We have discussed this in the modified manuscript."
