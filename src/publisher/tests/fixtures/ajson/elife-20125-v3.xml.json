To identify mutations contributing to common non-syndromic midline (sagittal and metopic) craniosynostosis, we performed exome sequencing of 132 parent-offspring trios and 59 additional probands. Thirteen probands (7%) had damaging de novo or rare transmitted mutations in <italic>SMAD6</italic>, an inhibitor of BMP \u2013 induced osteoblast differentiation (p<10<sup>\u221220</sup>). <italic>SMAD6</italic> mutations nonetheless showed striking incomplete penetrance (<60%). Genotypes of a common variant near <italic>BMP2</italic> that is strongly associated with midline craniosynostosis explained nearly all the phenotypic variation in these kindreds, with highly significant evidence of genetic interaction between these loci via both association and analysis of linkage. This epistatic interaction of rare and common variants defines the most frequent cause of midline craniosynostosis and has implications for the genetic basis of other diseases."

To identify mutations contributing to common non-syndromic midline (sagittal and metopic) craniosynostosis, we performed exome sequencing of 132 parent-offspring trios and 59 additional probands. Thirteen probands (7%) had damaging de novo or rare transmitted mutations in <italic>SMAD6</italic>, an inhibitor of BMP \u2013 induced osteoblast differentiation (p<10<sup>\u221220</sup>). <italic>SMAD6</italic> mutations nonetheless showed striking incomplete penetrance (<60%). Genotypes of a common variant near <italic>BMP2</italic> that is strongly associated with midline craniosynostosis explained nearly all the phenotypic variation in these kindreds, with highly significant evidence of genetic interaction between these loci via both association and analysis of linkage. This epistatic interaction of rare and common variants defines the most frequent cause of midline craniosynostosis and has implications for the genetic basis of other diseases."

However, one in 2,000 infants is born with a condition called craniosynostosis in which some of these bones have already fused. This fusion prevents the skull from growing properly, and can lead to the brain becoming compressed. As such, surgeons routinely undo the fusion in these infants to allow the brain and skull to grow normally."

Activation of BMP receptors leads to phosphorylation of receptor SMADs, which can complex with SMAD4, translocate to the nucleus and partner with RUNX2 to induce transcription of genes that promote osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib17\">Javed et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib13\">Hata et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4a</xref>). This process is inhibited by SMAD6 binding to phosphorylated receptor SMADs, forming an inactive complex. SMAD6 also inhibits BMP signaling by complexing with the ubiquitin ligase SMURF1, which ubiquitylates BMP receptors, receptor SMADs and RUNX2, leading to their proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"fig4\">Figure 4b</xref>) (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib26\">Murakami et al., 2003</xref>). This pathway plays a well-established role in the\u00a0development of the cranial vault and closure of cranial sutures. In mice, constitutive activity of BMPR1A in cranial neural crest results in SMAD-dependent development of metopic craniosynostosis (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib19\">Komatsu et al., 2013</xref>), and genetic deficiency for the SMAD inhibitor <italic>SMURF1</italic> causes midline craniosynostosis (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib34\">Shimazu et al., 2016</xref>).

There is extremely strong evidence implicating each locus independently, along with highly significant evidence from both analysis of association and linkage that the risk of craniosynostosis is markedly increased in individuals carrying risk alleles at both loci compared to those with only a single risk allele at either locus. Rare damaging variants in <italic>SMAD6</italic> alone impart very large effects on disease risk with low penetrance, with inheritance at <italic>BMP2</italic> explaining nearly all of the variation in occurrence of craniosynostosis seen among <italic>SMAD6</italic> mutation carriers. The results support a threshold effect model, with quantitative increases in SMAD signaling resulting from reduced inhibition of SMAD signaling by SMAD6, owing to haploinsufficiency (strongly supported by a plethora of LOF variants distributed across <italic>SMAD6</italic>), along with a putative increase in SMAD signaling owing to increased BMP2 expression via the risk SNP rs1884302 leading to accelerated closure of midline sutures.

Moreover, consistent with the common variant near <italic>BMP2</italic> modifying BMP2 expression, duplication of a nearby limb-specific enhancer increased BMP2 expression, leading to a Mendelian limb defect (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"bib4\">Dathe et al., 2009</xref>).

To avoid bias, exons analyzed were restricted to those that intersected between the Roche V2 and MedExome capture reagents. For genes with more than 1 LOF or D-mis variant in cases, aligned reads were visualized in silico at all variant positions in both cases and controls. For genes displaying p<0.005, we compared the burden of mutated alleles in cases to European subjects in the NHLBI ESP and ExAC databases.

The data are of very high quality, the manuscript clearly written, and the conclusions convincingly supported by the data. The investigators performed whole exome sequencing (WES) of 132 parent-offspring trios and 59 additional probands. Seven percent of probands had damaging de novo or rare transmitted mutations in SMAD6; an inhibitor of BMP \u2013 induced osteoblast differentiation (P <10-20). Interestingly, SMAD6 mutations showed striking incomplete penetrance for the craniosynostosis trait (<60%). Genotypes of a common variant near BMP2, previously shown to be strongly associated with midline craniosynostosis, explained nearly all of the phenotypic variance in these kindred. Thus, these findings clearly documented digenic inheritance via epistatic interactions of rare and common variants as a defining feature of the most frequent cause of midline craniosynostosis. This work has very important implications for the genetic basis of other disease traits and reveals a potential mechanism for common variant genetic effects to markedly influence the manifestation of disease."
